How To Run It
-------------
I built this program on NetBeans using Java. To run this program on a local IDE 
(preferably NetBeans to also see the sample GUI I started) then open a project
or folder and pick the “Insight_Generator” folder. Once it opens on the local 
IDE then you will just have to run it. However if the IDE is looking for the 
main java class, it is in the folder Insight_Generator → src → insight_generator
→ Insight_Generator.java. To know more about the code and how it runs there is
a broader comment section on top of the main class. The other files in this 
folder are the Input csv which is the sample data, the 
TestFiles with more csv files with different error outputs, and the Output 
folder which will contain the result generated by the program. 


How To Run Test Files 
---------------------

To run the TestFiles just open the project and in the main class 
Insight_Generator.java. There is a section where the variables are 
initially declared and the last variable declared is sourceFile, which 
is a string file that has the path to the Input.csv in the main folder. 
There is a wide comment section below it that describes the sources 
and the paths that it should be replaced with to test the program. 
Below are the test files and their description.

Test File 1   Name: Input - NoID.csv   Anomaly: Missing Customer ID
Test File 2   Name: Input - NoDate.csv   Anomaly: Missing Date
Test File 3   Name: Input - NoTransaction.csv   Anomaly: Missing Transactions  
              Note: No error generated because program considers missing 
              transactions at 0
Test File 4   Name: Input - NoAllCol.csv   Anomaly: Missing Cells in all columns 
Test File 5   Name: Input - MultipleMonth.csv  Desc: Customers with Multiple 
Month
Test File 6   Name: Input - LargeData.csv   Desc: Large Data greater than 1000 lines
              with multiple months and year
